            <p> Stephen Hawking was a theoretical physicist, cosmologist, and author. He was born on Jan 8, 1942 in Oxford, England. He passed away on March 14th, 2018.
                He made some crazy contributions to our understanding of the universe, specifically in the fields of cosmology, general relativity, and quantum mechanics. Unfortunately, he was diagnosed with ALS (amytrophic lateral sclerosis), which eventually paralyzed him, but that didn't stop his work.
                Some of his most notable achievements are: </p>

        <p>The pursuit of space exploration are integral with human progress. It can help us understand our place
        in the universe and why we are here in the first place. It can offer opportunities for scientific discoveries, innovation,
        and humanity's collective knowledge.</p>

        <p> Hawking made significant contributions to topics like black holes, cosmology, and theoretical physics. His research
            shaped our understanding of some of the most complex and mysterious phenomena in the cosmos. His work played a crucial
            role in advancing our understanding some of the universe's most intriguing questions.
