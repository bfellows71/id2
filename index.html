            <p> Stephen Hawking was a theoretical physicist, cosmologist, and author. He was born on Jan 8, 1942 in Oxford, England. He passed away on March 14th, 2018.
                He made some crazy contributions to our understanding of the universe, specifically in the fields of cosmology, general relativity, and quantum mechanics. Unfortunately, he was diagnosed with ALS (amytrophic lateral sclerosis), which eventually paralyzed him, but that didn't stop his work.
                Some of his most notable achievements are: </p>

        <p>The pursuit of space exploration are integral with human progress. It can help us understand our place
        in the universe and why we are here in the first place.</p>

        <h1>How did Hawking assist in those difficult questions?</h1>
        <p>His contributions directly contributed to advancing our understanding of the universe.
        His work expanded our knowledge on weird anomalies like black holes or Hawking radiation.
