        <p class="hidden-text-1">Stephen Hawking's most famous idea is known as Hawking Radiation.
            The radiation can be observed as something that reduces the mass and the energy of a black hole and is also known
            as black hole evaporation. Black holes that lose more mass than they gain can be estimated to shrink
            and then vanish.

        <p class="hidden-text-2">Singularity describes the conditions at which gravitational singularities can form, similar to the
            theory of the Big Bang. A singularity is a point in which spacetime becomes infinitely dense. They are often
            associated with black holes, since the gravity is so strong, that nothing can escape from the event horizon.</p>

        <p class="clickable-3">Theoretical Cosmology</p>
        <p class="hidden-text-3">Hawking explored the concept of the Bing Bang's singularity, proposing
            that the universe originated from a point of singularity 13.8 billion years ago. This theory in particular
            helped set the stage for more information about the universe's expansion, including inflationary cosmology.</p>
